For optimal performance and work, you should create
a ~/.smb/smb.conf file with the following value:

[global]
        unix charset = ISO-8859-1
        encrypt passwords = Yes
        wins support = No
        interfaces = YOUR_PRIMARY_IP/YOUR_NETMASK
        bind interfaces only = True
        log level=0
        debuglevel=0
